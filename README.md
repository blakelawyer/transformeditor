# transformeditor
Using matrix multiplication for image rotation.

**A 2D rotation transformation editor created as an exercise working through Szeliski's Computer Vision. With a simple GUI built with Kivy, the user is able to load images, and rotate them using matrix multiplication, as opposed to an existing image library.**
